### General Overview of Products and Brand
```
Lumina is a Canadian clean-inspired skincare and fragrance brand based in [your city]. We create intentional, handcrafted products designed for comfort, clarity, and everyday ease.

Our product line includes:
• Fragrance-free body butters formulated for dry skin and harsh Canadian winters
• Concentrated fragrance oils developed in-house without dilution oils or solvents
• [Any other products you have]

What makes Lumina unique:
• Every product is independently formulated, handcrafted, and packaged in small batches
• All formulation, packaging design, labels, and artwork are created in-house
• Our skincare and body care are fragrance-free, designed for sensitive skin and anyone who prefers products that work without announcing themselves
• Our fragrance line offers personal, balanced scents that feel like an extension of you rather than overpowering

Lumina was born from a personal journey with skin sensitivity and a belief that skincare doesn't need to multitask or promise the impossible—it just needs to do one thing well and do it thoughtfully. We're focused on creating products that feel like clean sheets, fresh pajamas, and a quiet moment where everything feels in order.

Our aesthetic is clean, modern, and calming with a focus on transparency, quality ingredients, and thoughtful craftsmanship. We believe our products would resonate beautifully with customers who appreciate intentional self-care, clean beauty, and locally-made Canadian goods.

Hi there,

My name is [Your Name], and I'm the founder of Lumina, a Canadian clean-inspired skincare and fragrance brand. I've been following Silla Designs for some time now, and I'm really impressed by your thoughtful curation and the beautiful aesthetic of your stores in Lethbridge and Calgary.

I'm reaching out to introduce Lumina and explore the possibility of having a conversation about carrying our products at your Chinook location (or both locations if there's interest). I'd love the opportunity to meet with you in person, bring samples of our products for you to experience firsthand, and discuss what a potential partnership might look like.

A bit about Lumina:
We create intentional, handcrafted skincare and fragrance products designed for comfort and everyday ease. Every product is independently formulated, handcrafted, and packaged in small batches right here in Canada. Our line includes fragrance-free body butters (perfect for dry skin and harsh Canadian winters) and concentrated fragrance oils developed in-house.

What makes us unique is our approach: our skincare and body care are fragrance-free for those who prefer products that work without announcing themselves, while our fragrance line offers personal, balanced scents for those who want that option. Everything from formulation to packaging design is created in-house with a focus on clarity, quality, and thoughtful craftsmanship.

I'd be happy to work around your schedule for a meeting at your Chinook location. I can bring product samples and we can have an open conversation about wholesale possibilities, what works for your store, and whether Lumina would be a good fit for your customers.

Would you be open to a chat? I'm flexible on timing and happy to accommodate whatever works best for you.

Thank you for considering Lumina, and I look forward to hearing from you!

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
Founder, Lumina
